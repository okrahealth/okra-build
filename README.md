# Okra-Build

DevOps and Data Engineering of [okra-core](https://github.com/okrahealth/okra)
and [okra-api](https://github.com/okrahealth/okra-api) will be handled by
this repository. Our general strategy is to deploy to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using Google Cloud.

The first release is only supporting python packages.

## Running the program locally
